# Foreword

Arcon is a Streaming Analytics engine developed in Rust. The system is meant to be either used as a standalone library or in the future
as a runtime through the [Arc](https://github.com/cda-group/arc) programming language.


Do note that the project is currently in development and should be considered experimental until further notice.
