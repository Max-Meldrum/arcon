# Operators

A streaming operator takes data and executes some form of transformation on it before
sending it downstream to other operators as part of a larger dataflow graph.


Arcon provides a set of pre-defined operators such as map, filter, and flatmap. However, it is also
possible to implement your own Operator.

TODO: Add link to custom_operator.rs example.
